# Task Tracking App

The Task Tracking App lets you save tasks, and add a reminder by double clicking (thats the green bar that shows up on the left)


I created this by following Brad Traversy's Task Tracker tutorial, found here, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8.


### Future Updates Planned:

* Add Node.js backend

* Add MongoDb database

* Add user authentication

* Add togglable dark theme
